# ML-Algorithmic-Trading

1. Engineered a multi-factor algorithmic trading system using unsupervised learning techniques (K-means clustering) on S&P 500 stocks, integrating advanced technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Fama French factors) and implementing efficient frontier max sharpe ratio optimization for portfolio construction. 
2. Developed a NLP-driven trading strategy for NASDAQ stocks, employing BERT for sentiment analysis on Twitter data, and utilizing a custom ranking algorithm and engagement metrics to generate alpha signals. The strategy involved selecting the top 5 ranked stocks each month, rebalancing the portfolio by closing positions that dropped out of the top 5, and opening positions in new stocks, leading to a dynamic investment approach aimed at maximizing return on investment over a specified period. 
3. Implemented an intraday volatility trading model combining GARCH forecasting for adaptive parameter estimation, incorporating high-frequency data and order book imbalance features to capture microstructure effects for statistical arbitrage opportunities.
